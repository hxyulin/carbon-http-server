# Carbon

## Goals
The main goal of carbon is to create a high performance and highly spec compliant HTTP parser (and sender) in rust.
However, in order to achieve these goals, there will be other smaller goals, including:
 - HTTP encoding decoding
 - High performant case insensitive ascii equality
 - HTTP/1 Test Suite (1.0, 1.1)
